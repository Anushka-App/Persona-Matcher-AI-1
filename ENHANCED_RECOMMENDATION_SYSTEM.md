# Enhanced Recommendation System

## Overview

The enhanced recommendation system combines **personality analysis** with **artwork theme preferences** and **bag type selections** to provide highly personalized and accurate bag recommendations. This system goes beyond simple keyword matching to create a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers multiple factors for each user.

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **1. Personality Quiz Analysis**
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Calculates personality scores based on quiz answers with weighted traits
- **Dominant Traits**: Identifies the top 3 personality traits (Boldness, Elegance, Whimsy)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for personality assessment

### **2. Two Additional Questions**
After the personality report, users answer two key questions:

#### **Question 1: Artwork Theme Selection**
```
Pick the artwork theme:
- Animal (wildlife and majestic creatures) ‚Üí Animals
- Flowers/Plants (blooms and leafy calm) ‚Üí Flowers/Plants  
- Nature/Landscape (vistas and natural forms) ‚Üí Nature/Landscape
- Pattern/Abstract (abstract shapes and geometry) ‚Üí Pattern/Abstract
- Symbols/Emblems (icons and meaningful symbols) ‚Üí Symbols/Emblems
- Vehicles/Transport ‚Üí Vehicles/Transport
- Food & Drink ‚Üí Food & Drink
- Other (Unspecified) ‚Üí Other (Unspecified)
```

#### **Question 2: Bag Type Preference**
```
If you had to choose one forever bag, which would you pick?
- Everyday bag (versatile for anything) ‚Üí Bag
- Tote bag (big carry-all) ‚Üí Tote
- Crossbody (hands-free) ‚Üí Crossbody
- Pouch (small essentials) ‚Üí Pouch
- Tech case (protects devices) ‚Üí Case
- Hobo bag (soft & slouchy) ‚Üí Hobo
```

### **3. Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm**

The system uses a weighted scoring algorithm with four key factors:

#### **Personality Trait Alignment (40% weight)**
- Analyzes how well each product matches the user's personality traits
- Uses keyword matching for Boldness, Elegance, and Whimsy
- Considers the user's dominant personality traits more heavily

#### **Artwork Theme Compatibility (30% weight)**
- Matches products to the selected artwork theme
- Uses comprehensive keyword mapping for each theme
- Provides fallback scoring for theme variations

#### **Bag Type Preference (20% weight)**
- Ensures the recommended products match the desired bag type
- Handles variations and synonyms for each bag type
- Prioritizes exact matches over similar types

#### **Sentiment Alignment (10% weight)**
- Considers the user's overall sentiment (Optimistic, Balanced, etc.)
- Matches products that reflect the user's emotional state
- Provides context for style preferences

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced Recommendation Engine**

```typescript
// Core scoring function
calculateProductMatchScore(product, userProfile) {
  let totalScore = 0;
  const reasons = [];
  
  // 1. Personality Trait Alignment (40%)
  const personalityScore = this.calculatePersonalityAlignment(product, userProfile.personalityScores);
  totalScore += personalityScore * 0.4;
  
  // 2. Artwork Theme Compatibility (30%)
  const artworkScore = this.calculateArtworkCompatibility(product, userProfile.artworkTheme);
  totalScore += artworkScore * 0.3;
  
  // 3. Bag Type Preference (20%)
  const bagTypeScore = this.calculateBagTypeCompatibility(product, userProfile.bagType);
  totalScore += bagTypeScore * 0.2;
  
  // 4. Sentiment Alignment (10%)
  const sentimentScore = this.calculateSentimentAlignment(product, userProfile.sentiment);
  totalScore += sentimentScore * 0.1;
  
  return { score: finalScore, reasons };
}
```

### **Personality-Artwork Mapping**

```typescript
personalityWeightMap = {
  'Boldness': {
    'Animals': 0.8,        // High compatibility
    'Nature/Landscape': 0.7,
    'Pattern/Abstract': 0.6,
    'Symbols/Emblems': 0.5,
    'Flowers/Plants': 0.4,  // Lower compatibility
    'Other (Unspecified)': 0.5
  },
  'Elegance': {
    'Flowers/Plants': 0.9,  // High compatibility
    'Pattern/Abstract': 0.8,
    'Symbols/Emblems': 0.7,
    'Nature/Landscape': 0.6,
    'Animals': 0.4,         // Lower compatibility
    'Other (Unspecified)': 0.6
  },
  'Whimsy': {
    'Pattern/Abstract': 0.9, // High compatibility
    'Symbols/Emblems': 0.8,
    'Animals': 0.7,
    'Flowers/Plants': 0.6,
    'Nature/Landscape': 0.5, // Lower compatibility
    'Other (Unspecified)': 0.7
  }
}
```

### **Bag Type Personality Mapping**

```typescript
bagTypePersonalityMap = {
  'Bag': {
    'Boldness': 0.6,
    'Elegance': 0.7,    // Higher elegance for everyday bags
    'Whimsy': 0.5
  },
  'Crossbody': {
    'Boldness': 0.8,    // Higher boldness for hands-free style
    'Elegance': 0.5,
    'Whimsy': 0.6
  },
  'Pouch': {
    'Boldness': 0.4,
    'Elegance': 0.8,    // Higher elegance for small accessories
    'Whimsy': 0.7
  }
  // ... more mappings
}
```

## üìä **Scoring System**

### **Match Score Calculation**
- **90-100%**: Perfect match with all criteria
- **80-89%**: Excellent match with minor variations
- **70-79%**: Good match with some compromises
- **60-69%**: Acceptable match with notable differences
- **Below 60%**: Poor match, not recommended

### **Confidence Indicators**
- **High Confidence (85%+)**: Strong personality signals and clear preferences
- **Medium Confidence (70-84%)**: Mixed signals but clear direction
- **Low Confidence (Below 70%)**: Unclear preferences, more variety needed

## üé® **Artwork Theme Keywords**

Each artwork theme has specific keywords for matching:

```typescript
artworkThemeKeywords = {
  'Animals': ['animal', 'wildlife', 'creature', 'beast', 'mammal', 'bird', 'fish', 'reptile'],
  'Flowers/Plants': ['flower', 'plant', 'bloom', 'petal', 'leaf', 'garden', 'botanical', 'floral'],
  'Nature/Landscape': ['nature', 'landscape', 'mountain', 'sea', 'ocean', 'forest', 'vista', 'scenery'],
  'Pattern/Abstract': ['pattern', 'abstract', 'geometric', 'design', 'shape', 'form', 'modern', 'artistic'],
  'Symbols/Emblems': ['symbol', 'emblem', 'icon', 'meaningful', 'timeless', 'heritage', 'cultural'],
  'Other (Unspecified)': ['mixed', 'variety', 'diverse', 'eclectic', 'unique', 'special']
}
```
